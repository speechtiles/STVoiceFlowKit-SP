# STVoiceFlowKit-SP Package for iOS and macOS
 ==============================================================

The Best Way to create engaging conversational speech interfaces for applications on iOS and macOS which blend with other existing application user interfaces. With frameworks provided by STVoiceFlowKit-SP from Speech Tiles you can do the following (and much, much more):

* Configure multiple Voiceflows for a single application, each Voiceflow to associate with specific application processes, states or views.
* Configure multiple Voiceflow Modules in each Voiceflow that execute various functionality such a Audio Playback, Audio Recording, Audio Dialog and Audio Listener.
* Configure automatic transition rules among Voiceflow Modules controlled by application, device events, other application events and multi-modal user input.
* Configure Voice Prompt Modules for audio playback that reference multiple audio segments pointing to a mix of recorded audio and realtime speech synthesis sources.
* Provide parameters for fine control over execution of most lower level media tasks: audio playback, audio recording, voice activity detection, echo cancelation, speech recognition, speech synthesis, etc.
* Select the speech recognition and speech synthesis engines that best suits your application.
* Select speech synthesis voices dynamically during runtime.
* Integrate your current application user interfaces with a comprehensive set of real-time Voiceflow event notifications in order to keep the user experience updated.
* Integrate your application with a powerful bi-directional dynamic data sharing, which allows your application and its Voiceflow processing to adapt and update the user experience in real time.
